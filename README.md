# Book-Search

<strong> Purpose of this app </strong>
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<p><small> The purpose of the Book Search app, is to grant access to the biggest, and I do mean BIGGEST, online library. All the user has to do is
enter a book title or an author into the search bar, and they will be given an array of books. There is no question that this app will provide
you with what you're seeking. It doesn't stop there, however. Upon receiving your search results you also get a brief synopsis as well, of what
the book is about. </small></p>

<i> I decided to include 2 pictures, searching 2 totally different books, as a means of showcasing just how diverse this app truly is. Now, 
obviously "Frankenstein" is a more well known title, but "The Good Daughter" is obviously lesser known. The two pictures also show the synopsis 
given of the books, along with the ability to save books you've searched for.</i>

  <strong> Plans for the Future </strong>
  
  <p> I might consider adding a more detailed background, and possibly some "white noise", to maybe add to the library vibe. </p>
